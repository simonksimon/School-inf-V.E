I made up a made-up company which sells a new type of a futuristic microwave and a holiday experince in a virtual reality. What could be the name of this company?

That sounds like a very interesting company idea. Here are some possible names for your company:
MicroVR: A company that combines microwave technology and virtual reality to offer a unique and immersive cooking and dining experience.
VirtuWave: A company that creates futuristic microwaves that can simulate any cuisine and flavor in virtual reality, as well as provide a holiday experience in different destinations.
MiraVoyage: A company that offers a dual service of microwaving and traveling in virtual reality, allowing customers to enjoy delicious meals and explore new places without leaving their homes.
ViraCook: A company that specializes in creating innovative microwaves that can cook any dish in minutes, and also provide a virtual reality headset that lets customers experience the culture and scenery of the dish’s origin.{

{Name I like the best is MiraVoyage.}
